      quick-lint-js' website contains <a href="vim.gif">vim.gif</a> which has
      the following license:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <ol type="I">
        <li>
          There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim
          except that they must include this license text. You can also
          distribute unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that
          they must include this license text. You are also allowed to include
          executables that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your
          own usage examples and Vim scripts.
        </li>

        <li>
          It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
          including executables and/or source code, when the following four
          conditions are met:
          <ol type="1">
            <li>This license text must be included unmodified.</li>
            <li>
              The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five
              ways:
              <ol type="a">
                <li>
                  If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe
                  in the distribution how to contact you. When the maintainer
                  asks you (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you
                  distributed, you must make your changes, including source
                  code, available to the maintainer without fee. The maintainer
                  reserves the right to include your changes in the official
                  version of Vim. What the maintainer will do with your changes
                  and under what license they will be distributed is negotiable.
                  If there has been no negotiation then this license, or a later
                  version, also applies to your changes. The current maintainer
                  is Bram Moolenaar
                  <a href="mailto:Bram@vim.org">Bram@vim.org</a>. If this
                  changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most
                  likely <a href="http://vim.sf.net">vim.sf.net</a>,
                  <a href="https://www.vim.org">www.vim.org</a> and/or
                  comp.editors). When it is completely impossible to contact the
                  maintainer, the obligation to send him your changes ceases.
                  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has received your
                  changes they will not have to be sent again.
                </li>

                <li>
                  If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
                  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
                  unmodified, as mentioned at I). If you make additional changes
                  the text under a) applies to those changes.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Provide all the changes, including source code, with every
                  copy of the modified Vim you distribute. This may be done in
                  the form of a context diff. You can choose what license to use
                  for new code you add. The changes and their license must not
                  restrict others from making their own changes to the official
                  version of Vim.
                </li>

                <li>
                  When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as
                  mentioned under c), you can distribute it without the source
                  code for the changes if the following three conditions are
                  met:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The license that applies to the changes permits you to
                      distribute the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee
                      or restriction, and permits the Vim maintainer to include
                      the changes in the official version of Vim without fee or
                      restriction.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      You keep the changes for at least three years after last
                      distributing the corresponding modified Vim. When the
                      maintainer or someone who you distributed the modified Vim
                      to asks you (in any way) for the changes within this
                      period, you must make them available to him.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact
                      you. This contact information must remain valid for at
                      least three years after last distributing the
                      corresponding modified Vim, or as long as possible.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                  When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the
                  changes, you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL
                  version 2 or any later version.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
              A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version"
              command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the
              modified Vim is able to see that it was modified. When
              distributing as mentioned under 2)e) adding the message is only
              required for as far as this does not conflict with the license
              used for the changes.
            </li>

            <li>
              The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not
              be removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
              corrections.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
          the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
          maintainer, including the source code. The preferred way to do this is
          by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.
          If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile)
          e-mailing a context diff will do. The e-mail address to be used is
          <a href="mailto:maintainer@vim.org">maintainer@vim.org</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the
          Vim sources, parts of it or from a modified version. You may use this
          license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they
          came with, at your option.
        </li>

          <strong>CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.</strong>
          This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other
          rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or
          country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you
          may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired
          the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the
          laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example,
          if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory
          country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:

          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <strong>Australia.</strong>
              You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law
              and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Canada.</strong>
              If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving
              updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting
              your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the
              Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and
              installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product
              documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates
              for your specific device or software.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Germany and Austria.</strong>

              <ol type="i">
                <li>
                  <strong>Warranty.</strong>
                  The properly licensed software will perform substantially as
                  described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the
                  software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in
                  relation to the licensed software.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong>
                  In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based
                  on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or
                  personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to
                  the statutory law.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be
                liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such
                material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which
                facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of
                which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the
                compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called
                "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence,
                Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

              >LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. You can recover from
              Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00.
              You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential,

            This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software,
            services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or
            third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract,
            breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
            negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about
            the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion
            may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the
            exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other
            damages.
